# TinyC Compiler Project

## Overview

This project involves the development of a TinyC compiler capable of handling both conditional and iterative statements. The primary goal of this project is to ensure robust and efficient code execution, providing a deeper understanding of compiler design, code optimization, and fundamental computer architecture concepts.

## Features

- **Conditional Statements**: Supports `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements for conditional branching in C programs.
- **Code Optimization**: Focuses on optimizing the generated assembly code for enhanced performance.
- **Parsing Techniques**: Utilizes advanced parsing techniques to ensure accurate and efficient compilation of C code.
- **Assembly Language Proficiency**: Demonstrates an in-depth understanding of assembly language and its role in computer architecture.

## Learning Outcomes

- Gained a comprehensive understanding of fundamental computer architecture concepts.
- Acquired expertise in optimizing code for performance.
- Developed proficiency in various parsing techniques used in compiler design.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A basic understanding of TinyC programming.
- Familiarity with assembly language and computer architecture concepts.
- Experience with compiler construction principles.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akhilsai0099/TinyC-Compiler/
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd TinyC-Compiler
   ```

### Usage

- To compile a TinyC program:
  ```bash
  tcc.py yourfile.tc
  ```
- The compiled output will be assembly code which can be run using spim.
